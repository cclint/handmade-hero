# Intro
This is a collection of personal notes following [Handmade Hero](https://handmadehero.org/).

Anyone with an interest in programming that finds the idea of building a game engine from scratch to be exciting, I highly recommend following *Casey Muratori's* Handmade Hero series. 

Big thanks to *Casey Muratori* for your time and effort in developing this project.
